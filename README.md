# Data_Mining_5_Blackbox_Methods

This repository contains an R Markdown assignment report that evaluates three black-box classification modelsâ€”**K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**, **Support Vector Machines (SVM)**, and **Neural Networks (NN)**. The project focuses on implementing these models, tuning hyperparameters, evaluating their performance, and comparing them against each other using classification metrics.

### Business Problem

In real-world classification problems, relationships between predictors and outcomes are often complex and non-linear. Traditional models like linear regression or decision trees may fail to capture this complexity. **Black-box methods** offer powerful alternatives that can model non-linear boundaries, though at the cost of interpretability.

This assignment explores how KNN, SVM, and NN perform on a structured dataset and highlights the trade-offs between accuracy and explainability in predictive modeling.

### Project Objective

The key objectives of this assignment were:

- To implement three black-box classification algorithms: KNN, SVM, and Neural Networks
- To perform hyperparameter tuning using cross-validation
- To evaluate models based on metrics such as **accuracy**, **precision**, **recall**, and **confusion matrices**
- To compare the performance of the models and discuss when each is most appropriate
- To reflect on the challenges and limitations of using black-box models in practice

### Solution Approach

The assignment was structured around a consistent machine learning pipeline:

- **Data Preprocessing**:
  - Scaled and normalized data for fair comparisons
  - Created train-test splits
- **Model Training**:
  - **KNN** using the `caret` package with grid tuning for the optimal *k*
  - **SVM** using the `svm()` function with radial kernel and cost tuning
  - **Neural Network** using the `nnet` package with hidden layer tuning
- **Model Evaluation**:
  - Compared metrics across all models using confusion matrices and cross-validation results
  - Highlighted precision, recall, and F1-score trade-offs
- **Visualization**:
  - Displayed performance through plots for accuracy, misclassification, and model complexity

### Business Value

While this assignment was academic, the methodology has strong industry relevance:

- **Robust Performance**: These models can outperform traditional ones when dealing with non-linear relationships
- **Flexibility**: Each model adapts differently to various data types and distributions
- **Benchmarking**: A comparative framework helps identify which model suits specific business needs
- **Scalability**: Especially relevant in fields like fraud detection, bioinformatics, and customer classification

### Challenges Encountered

- **Model Tuning**: Hyperparameter tuning (e.g., cost for SVM, hidden nodes in NN) required experimentation and cross-validation
- **Overfitting**: Complex models like neural networks were prone to overfitting without regularization
- **Interpretability**: Results were harder to explain compared to simpler models like decision trees or logistic regression
